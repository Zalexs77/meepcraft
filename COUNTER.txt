The new update includes a copy-ip button and a revamp of the old counter script.

Which ip is copied can be changed in the index.html file.
On line 170 you will find this bit of code:
<input id="server-ip" type="text" value="mc.Hypixel.net"> 
Simply change mc.Hypixel.net to your server ip and the copy button should now copy that ip to the player's clipboard.

If you want to change the way the amount of players is shown, you can edit the format using a data tag. Example:
Players on play.cubecraft.net: <span counter-ip="play.cubecraft.net" counter-format="{online}/{max}">0</span>

The main tags you are able to use to customize your message with are:

counter-ip="play.cubecraft.net" will retrieve the actual amount of players.
counter-format="{online}/{max}" is the format that is used in this instance.
If you just add the counter-ip, it will only return the number of players currently online.

To show if a server is offline or online add 'counter-ip="us.mineplex.com" counter-status'. Example:
Mineplex is currently <span counter-ip="us.mineplex.com" counter-status>...</span>

The ... is whatever is shown when the script couldn't receive the status, most likely it will return offline.

Example (Default):
<h2 class="counter">Our server is <span counter-ip="mc.Hypixel.net" counter-status>...</span>, with <span style="color:lightgreen;" counter-ip="mc.Hypixel.net">0</span> other players!</h2>
